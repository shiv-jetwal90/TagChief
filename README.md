# Local Testing
To test locally on your machine you need to install python3 and all dependencies in requirements.txt after installing all the dependencies just run python3 app.py
# Heroku Testing
I hosted this app on heroku so to test just visit https://shivjetwal.herokuapp.com/ and UI have functionality to tell which button you need to use for which operation.
